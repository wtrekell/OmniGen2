## 🔥 News
- **2025-06-20**: Updated [resource requirements](#-resources-requirement), adding CPU offload support for devices with limited VRAM.
- **2025-06-16**: [Gradio](https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/OmniGen2?tab=readme-ov-file#-gradio-demo) and [Jupyter](https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/OmniGen2/blob/main/example.ipynb) is available.
- **2025-06-16**: We release **OmniGen2**, a multimodal generation model, model weights can be accessed in [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/OmniGen2/OmniGen2) and [modelscope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/OmniGen2/OmniGen2).


## Introduction
**OmniGen2** is a powerful and efficient unified multimodal model. Its architecture is composed of two key components: a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) and a 4B diffusion model. This dual-component architecture enables strong performance across four primary capabilities:

- **Visual Understanding**: Inherits the robust ability to interpret and analyze image content from its Qwen-VL-2.5 foundation.
- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Creates high-fidelity and aesthetically pleasing images from textual prompts.
- **Instruction-guided Image Editing**: Executes complex, instruction-based image modifications with high precision, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.
- **In-context Generation**: A versatile capability to process and flexibly combine diverse inputs—including humans, reference objects, and scenes—to produce novel and coherent visual outputs.

As an open-source project, OmniGen2 provides a powerful yet resource-efficient foundation for researchers and developers exploring the frontiers of controllable and personalized generative AI.

**We will release the training code, dataset, and data construction pipeline soon. Stay tuned!**

## 💡 Usage Tips
To achieve optimal results with OmniGen2, you can adjust the following key hyperparameters based on your specific use case.
- `text_guidance_scale`: Controls how strictly the output adheres to the text prompt (Classifier-Free Guidance).
- `image_guidance_scale`: This controls how much the final image should resemble the input reference image.
    - **The Trade-off**: A higher value makes the output more faithful to the reference image's structure and style, but it might ignore parts of your text prompt. A lower value (~1.5) gives the text prompt more influence.
    - **Tip**: For image editing task, we recommend to set it between 1.2 and 2.0; for in-context generateion task, a higher image_guidance_scale will maintian more details in input images, and we recommend to set it between 2.5 and 3.0.
- `max_pixels`: Automatically resizes images when their total pixel count (width × height) exceeds this limit, while maintaining its aspect ratio. This helps manage performance and memory usage.
  - **Tip**: Default value is 1024*1024. You can reduce this value if you encounter memory issues.
- `max_input_image_side_length`: Maximum side length for input images.
- `negative_prompt`: Tell the model what you don't want to see in the image.
    - **Example**: blurry, low quality, text, watermark
    - **Tip**: For the best results, try experimenting with different negative prompts. If you're not sure, just use the default negative prompt.
- `enable_model_cpu_offload`: **Reduces VRAM usage by nearly 50% with a negligible impact on speed**.
  - This is achieved by offloading the model weights to CPU RAM when they are not in use.
  - See: [Model Offloading](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/memory#model-offloading)
- `enable_sequential_cpu_offload`: Minimizes VRAM usage to less than 3GB, but at the cost of significantly slower performance.
  - This works by offloading the model in submodules and loading them onto the GPU sequentially as needed.
  - See: [CPU Offloading](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/memory#cpu-offloading)
- `cfg_range_start`, `cfg_range_end`: Define the timestep range where CFG is applied. Per this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07724), reducing cfg_range_end can significantly decrease inference time with a negligible impact on quality.
  
**Some suggestions for improving generation quality:**
- Use high-resolution and high-quality images. Images that are too small or blurry will also result in low-quality output. We recommend ensuring that the input image size is greater than 512 whenever possible.
- Provide detailed instructions. For in-context generation tasks, specify which elements from which image the model should use.
- Try to use English as much as possible, as OmniGen2 currently performs better in English than in Chinese.


## 💻 Resources Requirement
OmniGen2 natively requires an **NVIDIA RTX 3090** or an equivalent GPU with approximately **17GB of VRAM**. For devices with less VRAM, you can enable **CPU Offload** to run the model.

**Performance Tip**: To improve inference speed, consider decreasing the `cfg_range_end` parameter. Within a reasonable range, this has a negligible impact on output quality.
